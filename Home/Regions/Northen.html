                            Hanoi's Pho is a famous dish in the capital city. The locals are unsure of when it first

                            Hanoi pho was first known through street vendors carrying it on their shoulder poles. At
                            that

                            referred to it as "pho ganh," which gave the dish its own unique charm. These pho vendors
